Feature: Non-levy learner provider retrospectively notifies a withdrawal before 42 days- PV2-3642
	As a provider,
	I want a Non-levy learner, where the provider retrospectively notifies a withdrawal before 42 days and previously paid monthly instalments are refunded
	So that I am accurately paid my apprenticeship provision.


Scenario:  Provider retrospectively notifies of a withdrawal before 42 days for a non-levy learner after payments have already been made PV2-3642
    Given the provider previously submitted the following learner details
